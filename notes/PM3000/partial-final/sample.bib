(1)   Many different proofs exist for this most fundamental of all geometric theorems. The theorem can also be generalized from a plane triangle to a trirectangular tetrahedron, in which case it is known as de Gua’s theorem. The various proofs of the Pythagorean theorem all seem to require application of some version or consequence of the parallel postulate: proofs by dissection rely on the complementarity of the acute...}, author={Weisstein, Eric W.}, language={en} }

The distance r from the center is called the radius, and the point O is called the center. Twice the radius is known as the diameter d=2r. The angle a circle subtends from its center is a full angle, equal to 360 degrees or 2pi radians. A circle has the maximum possible area for a given perimeter, and the minimum possible perimeter for a given area. The perimeter C of a circle is called the circumference,...}, author={Weisstein, Eric W.}, language={en} }
