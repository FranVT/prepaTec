(1)   Many different proofs exist for this most fundamental of all geometric theorems. The theorem can also be generalized from a plane triangle to a trirectangular tetrahedron, in which case it is known as de Guaâ€™s theorem. The various proofs of the Pythagorean theorem all seem to require application of some version or consequence of the parallel postulate: proofs by dissection rely on the complementarity of the acute...}, author={Weisstein, Eric W.}, language={en} }

The distance r from the center is called the radius, and the point O is called the center. Twice the radius is known as the diameter d=2r. The angle a circle subtends from its center is a full angle, equal to 360 degrees or 2pi radians. A circle has the maximum possible area for a given perimeter, and the minimum possible perimeter for a given area. The perimeter C of a circle is called the circumference,...}, author={Weisstein, Eric W.}, language={en} }

This results in the two-center bipolar coordinate equation  r_1+r_2=2a,  (1)   where a is the semimajor axis and the origin of the coordinate system is at one of the foci.
