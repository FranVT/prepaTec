\paragraph{Exercise 1}
When a certain medical drug is administered to a patient, the number of milligrams remaining in the patient's bloodstream after $t$ hours is modeled by \[D(t)=50\exp\qty[-0.2t]\] How many milligrams of the drug remain in the patient's bloodstream after $3$ hours?

\paragraph{Exercise 2}
The initial size of a culture of bacteria is $2000$.
After 1 hour the bacteria count is $10000$.
Find a function $n(t)=n_o\exp\qty[rt]$ that models the population after $t$ hours and find the population after $2$ hours.

\paragraph{Exercise 3}
Solve the logarithm equation fo $x$ \[5\ln\qty(3-x)=4.\]

\paragraph{Exercise 4}
Use the Laws of Logarithms to combine the expression into a single longarithm \[\log(a)+2\log(b).\]

\paragraph{Exercise 5}
Give the range of the following function $f(x)=e^{x-5}+6$.

\paragraph{Exercise 6}
Which of the following functions shows a logarithmic function base $e$ with a translation of 5 units left and 4 units downward andtends to minus infinity $(f(x)\to-\infty)$ whent the domain tends to $4$ $(x\to4)$,
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f(x)=\log(x+5)+4$ 
    \item $f(x)=\log(x-5)+4$
    \item $f(x)=-\log(x+5)-4$ 
    \item $f(x)=-\log(x+5)+4$ 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Exercise 7}
Write and use the change of base formula to compute the following,\[\log_2\qty[\frac{1}{2}].\]

\paragraph{Exercise 8}
Usethe Laws of Epxonents to rewrite and simplify the expression
\[\qty(\sqrt[4]{a})^{3}.\]

\paragraph{Exercise 9}
Expand and simplify
\[(4x-1)(3x+7)\]
